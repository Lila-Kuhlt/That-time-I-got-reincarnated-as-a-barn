# Plants

Plants are used to provied buffs to turrets and be sold on the market.
Each plant gives different buffs.

## Crops

| Name     | Soil | [Stats](/concept/README.md#stats)   | 
|----------|------|---------|
| Chilli   | Dirt | AS, PS  | 
| Potato   | Dirt | DMG, KB | 
| Tomato   | Dirt | AOE     | 
| Aubergine| Dirt | PEN     | 

***Remark***: It is possible that plants will require other soil types than dirt in
the future.

***Remark***: There is a draft where plants also buff their neighbour plants, so
that if the same type of plants are placed in groups they give stronger buffs.

## Growth stages
Plants are weaker in different stages of growth.
